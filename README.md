# Flutter Technical Test

## Task 1: Build a Simple Movie App

* Create a new Flutter project using the command line or your preferred IDE.
* Build a movie app that displays a list of movies , with at least two screens: a home screen and a detail screen.
* Use any styling library or framework of your choice to make the app visually appealing.
* Implement dynamic data fetching and display by using the following RESTful API [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/4/getting-started/authorization).

* Implement a search bar that allows users to search for movies by title.
* When a user taps on a movie from the list, it should take them to the movie's detail screen, which displays more information about the movie, such as its release date, rating, and description.

## Task 2: Implement Navigation and State Management

* Implement navigation between the home screen and the detail screen using Flutter's built-in Navigator class.
* Use Flutter's built-in state management solution, such as setState or Provider, to manage state between the screens, such as the search query and the selected movie.

---

## Task 3: Write Unit Tests

* Write unit tests for the critical functions of your app, such as fetching and displaying movie data, and implementing search functionality.
* Write any additional tests you feel are necessary to ensure that the app functions correctly.

----

## Submission Guidelines

* The zip file should be named {yourname}.zip, and should contain the Flutter Application project folder with your submission.
* The zip file should contain the [FOLLOW_UP.md](./FOLLOW_UP.md) file with answers to the follow-up questions.
